# Renewable Project Screening Studio

A deployed Python and Streamlit web app for screening UK renewable energy infrastructure projects using public planning data.

## Project Summary

This project turns public renewable energy planning data into an interactive project-screening tool.

It allows users to explore renewable project pipelines, compare regional capacity, map developments, generate project briefs and run simplified offshore wind feasibility calculations.

## Why I Built This

I built this project to connect mechanical engineering, energy infrastructure and data analysis.

The aim was to demonstrate that I can take a real-world dataset, clean it, analyse it, build a useful interactive tool, deploy it online and explain the engineering assumptions behind it.

## Features

- Filter renewable projects by technology, region and development status
- View total, average and project-level capacity
- Analyse capacity by technology and region
- Analyse capacity by development stage
- Map UK renewable energy projects
- Generate project briefs
- Compare similar projects
- Score projects using a transparent screening model
- Estimate offshore wind generation, revenue, CAPEX and payback
- Estimate annual and lifetime carbon savings
- Run sensitivity analysis on capacity factor
- Download filtered project data

## Tools Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- pandas
- Plotly
- pyproj
- Git/GitHub
- Streamlit Community Cloud

## Engineering Relevance

This project demonstrates:

- data cleaning
- geospatial data handling
- engineering assumptions
- infrastructure project screening
- basic techno-economic modelling
- dashboard deployment
- documentation and communication

## Methodology

The offshore wind model estimates:

- annual energy generation
- turbine count
- annual revenue
- CAPEX
- simple payback period
- carbon savings

Full details are available in `METHODOLOGY.md`.

## Limitations

This is a simplified portfolio project. It is not an investment-grade renewable energy model and does not include detailed wind resource modelling, financing, operational expenditure, grid connection cost, curtailment or planning-risk modelling.
